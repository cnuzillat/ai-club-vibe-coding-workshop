# To-Do Application Built with Gemini CLI

This project includes a simple to-do application developed using the Gemini CLI as part of RIT's AI Club workshop focused on AI-assisted development workflows.

The application was built through an iterative, prompt-driven process. Rather than beginning with a fully specified design, functionality was developed incrementally by describing requirements, reviewing generated code, and refining behavior through successive prompts. The Gemini CLI was used to assist with initial project scaffolding, feature implementation, and code refinement.

This approach emphasizes human-in-the-loop development, where the developer remains responsible for design decisions, correctness, and code quality, while the AI accelerates routine tasks and supports rapid experimentation. The project serves as a practical example of how AI tools can be integrated into modern software development workflows for prototyping and learning.
